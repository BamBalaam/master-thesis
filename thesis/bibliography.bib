        It contains an overview of the language, a fully defined grammar and many other aspects.
        Other than serving as a language definition, the book also teaches some basic aspects of
        logic and linguistics, to ease the reader into learning it.

    annotation = {
        Proposal of a system that "meets the computer halfway": a platform where a human communicates
        with a computer by learning a new language (as opposed to a programming language) and the computer
        only has to translate that language (Lojban) into a semantic representation. This system attempts
        to prove that Lojban could potentially be a good contender for a good machine interlingua.

        Proposal of a language, named Lojban++, which is a subset of Lojban augmented with
        English vocabulary. The article postulates that such a language could be a strong
        contender to communicate with AGI (artificial general intelligence) systems since a
        language based on predicate logic would be easier to teach to an artificial intelligence
        than any natural language.
