\chapter{Future work}

\vspace{0.5cm}

Creating tools for a constructed language is a pharaonic project, and a lot more could be done for this project,
but this thesis could not cover more due to lack of time. I would enjoy continuing to work on these tools and grammar,
mainly on the following aspects:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Address more aspects of the grammar}: go further along the companion book and parse even more sentences;
\item \textbf{Visualisation module}: the output generated by the "visitor" module could be presented in a visual interface,
to be even more pedagogic for prospective students of the language;
\item \textbf{Improve visitor functions}: the current setup is quite time-consuming, some investigation is needed to see if
it is possible to extend the Parsimonious\footcite{parsimonious} python library in order to create functions which are more generic;
\item \textbf{Get definitions of cmavo/selma'o from the grammar itself}: another frustration encountered during the development of
the visitor module was the need to duplicate definitions from the grammar into the code - another possible extension and
open-source contribution to the Parsimonious library could be modify how the grammar rules are gathered and allow to access
comments from within the Parse Tree nodes.
\end{itemize}
