\chapter{Breaking down parsed sentences: the ``visitor'' module}

\section{Methodology}

Parsimonious has the visitor function. Allows to explore the parse tree generated

What we achieve is a mix of Parts-Of-Speech tagging (giving each word a grammatical category) and Semantic role labeling
because tagging verbs allows us, thanks to their definition, to know which word accomplishes what role in the sentence.
