\section{Introduction}

As seen in REF HERE, the existing formal grammars for Lojban are extremely complete. They cover the entirety of the language, both in its morphology and syntax/semantics, which means they can even validate words that don't exist yet. However, this completion makes these formal grammars extremely complex to read for a beginner. \\

For any other language, using a formal grammar file as a learning companion would be a very obscure method. However, Lojban being a language that can be parsed just as a programming language would, it would be very interesting to build a formal grammar file which would help a prospective student understand the intrinsic rules behind the language's grammar. \\

Of course, improving the reading comprehension of the formal grammar file reduces the complete aspect of it:

\begin{itemize}
  \item It is almost impossible to address all rules of the grammar;
  \item Ignoring the morphology of words means that unknown but valid words won't be parsable;
\end{itemize}

This chapter will explore the main reference for Lojban (\cite{cowan1997complete}), in its 2016 revised version, and write a simplified parser for a subset of the language.
